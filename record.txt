Fairy Tale --传奇
Michael Learns To Rock
In that misty morning when I saw your smiling face
正是那个雾朦朦的早晨我看到你笑盈盈的脸
You only looked at me and I was yours
你只看了我一眼就把我的魂儿牵
But when I turned around you were nowhere to be seen
可我一转身你却在我眼前消失不见
You had walked away and closed the door
你早已走开，从此再也没出现
When will I see you again
几时我会与你再见面
When will the sky stop to rain
几时天空会停雨现晴天
When will all the stars start to shine
几时满天星星会开始闪
When will I know that you’re mine
几时我会知道花好月团圆
Did I ever meet you in the sunshine?
是否，晴空下我曾遇见你
And when we were both a thousand years away
其时我俩都是相隔千年远
Did I ever hold you in the moon light?
是否，月光下我曾拥着你
Did we make every minute last another day?
是否，临别的前一天我们时刻在缠绵
On the cold December night I gave my heart to you
十二月份那个寒冷的夜里我把心交给了你
And by the summer you were gone
夏日到来时你却已走远
Now as the days grow older and the stars will start to dim
如今岁月荏苒星光也会渐渐黯
All I have are memories and this song
且用这首歌我把你深深思念
When will I see you again
几时我会与你再见面
When will the sky stop to rain
几时天空会停雨现晴天
When will all the stars start to shine
几时满天星星会开始闪
When will I know that you’re mine
几时我会知道花好月团圆
Did I ever meet you in the sunshine?
是否，晴空下我曾遇见你
And when we were both a thousand years away
其时我俩都是相隔千年远
Did I ever hold you in the moon light?
是否，月光下我曾拥着你
Did we make every minute last another day?
是否，临别的前一天我们时刻在缠绵
When will I see you again
几时我会与你再见面
When will the sky stop to rain
几时天空会停雨现晴天
When will all the stars start to shine
几时满天星星会开始闪
When will I know that you’re mine
几时我会知道花好月团圆
In that misty morning I saw your smiling face
那个雾蒙蒙的早晨我看到你笑盈盈的脸
原歌词版本
In that misty morning when I saw your smiling face
You only looked at me and I was yours
But when I turned around
You were nowhere to be seen
You had walked away and closed the door
When will I see you again
When will the sky stop to rain
When will the stars start to shine
When will I know that you're mine
Did I ever meet you in the sunshine
And when we were both a thousand years away
Did I ever hold you in the moonlight
And did we make every minute last another day
On a cold December night I gave my heart to you
And by the summer you were gone
Now as the days grow older and the stars will start to dim
All I have are memories and this song
When will I see you again
When will the sky stop to rain
When will the stars start to shine
When will I know that you're mine
Did I ever meet you in the sunshine
And when we were both a thousand years away
Did I ever hold you in the moonlight
Did we make every minute last another day
When will I see you again
When will the sky stop to rain
When will the stars start to shine
When will I know that you're mine
In that misty morning when I saw your smiling face
